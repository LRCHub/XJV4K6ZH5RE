Some things are worth the bruises
Some things are worth the hurt
I like the way your face looks towards me
Try just a little harder
Try and make this time for me
I like the way your glances deceive me

I gave myself away
And yes, I meant to give you warning
But what did I say
You can call me in the morning
I'm living my life in reverse

Make me a compilation
Make me do what you will
'Cause I like the way you use your fingers
Grant me a conversation
Grant me a shard of your life
'Cause I like the way your fringe shapes your features

I gave myself away
And yes, I meant to give you warning
But what did I say
You can call me in the morning
I'm living my life in reverse

I'm living my life in reverse order
And yes, I tried to warn ya
I'm living my life in reverse order
And since you ask, well I tried to warn her

Watching the light stretch through the curtains
Watching the evening fade
I like the way that you fold your body
