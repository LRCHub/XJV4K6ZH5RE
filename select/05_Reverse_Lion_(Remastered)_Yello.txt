Some days up, some days down
Think I'll jump into the river and drown
With no means for healing, no cure can be found
If I end up drinking everything in the room
I'm just, actin' a fool, forgetting you
Actin' a fool, forgetting you

Look over the horizon, what do you see?
Another sun is setting on me
Last rays of sunlight, taking my sanity
If you see me howling, howling at the moon
I'm just, actin' a fool, forgetting you
Actin' a fool, forgetting you

Everyone has a story, every song has an end
Now I am finished and I won't sing again
I'll drink myself green, don't mind that money I spend
You were the last thing I had left to lose
I'll be, actin' a fool, forgetting you
Actin' a fool, forgetting you

Some days up, some days down
Think I'll jump into the river and drown
With no means for healing, no cure can be found
If I end up drinking everything in the room
I'm just, actin' a fool, forgetting you
Actin' a fool, forgetting you
Actin' a fool, forgetting you
I'm just actin' a fool, forgetting you
